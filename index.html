							On this page, you can gain some insights on Singapore Tourism from the data visualizations presented<br> 
							below. The number of international visitors traveling to Singapore has been increasing steadily over<br> 
							the last few decades until year 2019 where the COVID-19 pandemic hits the world. The tourists has <br>
							dropped tremendously for 2 years and only started to recover in Mar 2022. <br><br>
							Note: Data of the international visitors include only those by Air and Sea, and not those by Land.

						From this chart, it shows that Singapore received the most tourists in year 2018 and 2019. 
						The number of tourists hit as high as 1.8 mil per month.<br><br>
						In 2020, the number of tourist plunged to the lowest point and only start to recover 
						from Mar 2022. Until today, the number of visitors has not reached the previous peak.

						The Choropleth map shows the quantity of international visitors by
							country arriving in
							Singapore from Aug 2022 to Jul 2023. We see that Indonesia tourists are the largest group of visitors in Singapore, 
							follow by India, Malaysia, Australia, China, Philipines and United States of America.

						The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown of international visitors by region. SouthEast Asia took the top 
						ranked every year. Greater China took the second position and follow by Europe.

						The scatterplot shows the relationship between the hotel occupancy and the number of visitors over the last six years.
						One would have expected that when the number of tourists is high, hotel occupancy should be high and when the number of 
						tourists is low, the hotel occupancy should be low. But during COVID-19 pandemic, the visitors were low, but the hotel occupancy 
						is able to reach 40% to 80%. This is due to most hotels have closed many of the their rooms during the period.<br><br>

						Finally, let us look at the pattern of Singaporeans travelling overseas on a heatmap. As expected, during the
						pandemic years, very few Singaporeans travel overseas. Besides that, it also shows many Singaporeans travelling
						in the months of Mar, Jun, Nov and Dec every year. This is because those are the months of Singapore school holidays. 
						Many families travel overseas during these few months.
